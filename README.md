# MO444 Machine Learning

Repository with projects from course "MO444 - Machine Learning" offered by the Institute of Computing at Unicamp.

### Project 1 - Unsupervised Learning

This assignment aims to apply unsupervised learning methods to solve clustering and dimensionality reduction in two distinct tasks:
* A standard 2d task
* A task specified by the group with more dimensions. For the task selected, it's required to describe the problem addressed, the features used (type/values/description), and the dataset size.

### Project 2 - Supervised Learning

This assignment aims to apply learning methods to solve classification and regression tasks. In each task, we were requested to use the appropriate metrics and learning methods. For the first task, was required to implement a Gradient Descent-based optimizer from scratch.

### Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning

This assignment aims to apply Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning Methods to solve the Pac-Man game. We used the environment available in http://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs372/fall2017/Code/search.zip. In this project we used the smallClassic, mediumClassic, and originalClassic layouts.

### Project 4 - Final Project

This work aims to build a Machine Learning system to solve a problem chosen by the group inserted into one of ONUâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). We used Amazon from space competition from Kaggle as our problem.
